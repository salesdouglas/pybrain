Get it
Make sure you have the dependencies.

Option 1: If you have setuptools/easy_install, you can get the latest stable release from the cheeseshop directly, and set up automatically:
$ easy_install structure pybrain

Option 2: Download it from here. Unpack it.

Option 3: Get the bleeding edge from the git repository:

$ git clone https://github.com/pybrain/pybrain.git

Set it up
If you have setuptools, run (you may need to do this as superuser on Unix systems):

$ python setup.py install

If the above fails, you can also try installing with pip via:

$ cd pybrain 
$ sudo pip install . 

Alternatively run pip install . --user to install it for the current user only.
Otherwise: Update the PYTHONPATH environment variable to include the location of pybrain. 

$ export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:`pwd`

Verify
$ python

Python 2.5.2 (r252:60911, Sep 17 2008, 11:21:23)

Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.

>>> import pybrain
>>>

Or if you want to be more thorough:

$ cd pybrain/tests
$ python runtests.py
